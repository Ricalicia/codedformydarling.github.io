<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>You’ve asked me numerous times why I love you, what makes you different from other guys, and after prolonging it for so long, I thought it was time to tell you now.</p>

<h2>How You Listen and Respect Me</h2>
<p>One of the reasons why I love you is because you listen to me when I talk. You make me feel seen. You make me feel heard. You actually respond when I talk to you about something and you actually try to make a difference and change certain habits. You respect me. You don’t put me down. You always compliment me. You fill me with love. You always reassure me. You make sure that I don’t get any second guesses. You don’t give me time to doubt how you feel because of the amount of times that you tell me that you love me.</p>

<h2>How You Make Me Feel</h2>
<p>When I’m with you I don’t feel so stressed. I feel happier. I’m not as depressed anymore. I feel safe and chosen.</p>

<h2>Consistency and Long-Term Effort</h2>
<p>You’re very consistent with everything that you do, especially when it comes to me. Like when you were pursuing me — I mean seven years is a lot — and for you to just always be honest about your feelings, it’s really nice.</p>

<h2>Your Character and Personality</h2>
<p>One thing that I really love about your character is that you’re kind in a way that’s very cringe and corny, but I love it. You’re genuine about your feelings for me.</p>

<h2>Long Distance Effort</h2>
<p>You make that very clear with us being in a long-distance relationship. Even when you’re busy, you make time for me. You always text me first thing in the morning. If we don’t talk all day, you’re gonna make time for us to talk even if it’s late at night. You always call me. You always text me.</p>

<h2>What Makes You Different</h2>
<p>What makes you different from other people and other men is the fact that you don’t just give generic compliments or generic answers. When I ask you something specific, you actually go into detail about how you love me, why you love me, and what you love about me. You answer all of my silly questions. Unlike other men, you aren’t overly sexual or focused on that in every conversation, and you never make me feel uncomfortable.</p>

<h2>Respecting Boundaries</h2>
<p>I also love the fact that when we talked and I said I felt like things were moving a bit too fast, you actually slowed down, listened to me, and made sure I was comfortable with everything you were doing.</p>

<h2>Our History Together</h2>
<p>We’ve been friends for a very long time — since seventh grade. I’m now a sophomore in college, and our friendship stayed close until Christmas Eve last year when we officially started dating. That history makes our relationship feel really special.</p>

<h2>Your Growth and Change</h2>
<p>The main thing for me is that you’re willing to change for the better. You had some bad habits before, but now you actually care about other people’s feelings. You’re not manipulative anymore. You actually try to be a better person, and you show that you don’t just talk about it — you actually do it.</p>

<h2>Our Dynamic and Playfulness</h2>
<p>I love that we crack jokes on each other, that we’re lovable with each other. Even if it’s corny, we fake-argue sometimes, but then we go back to being lovey-dovey.</p>

<h2>Nicknames and Affection</h2>
<p>I also love the little things that are just ours, like the crazy nicknames you give me. Coconut Locks, Cherry Blood Blossom, Sugar Dumpling, and even my “gorgeous buried lemon cocoa fried dumpling cake” — all of them always make me smile. They’re funny, a little ridiculous, and so clearly you. I love that we have our own special way of being playful and affectionate.</p>

<h2>Loving Your Imperfections</h2>
<p>I love that you’re kind and that you make me feel special. Even as a little tiny boy that you are, you make me feel great. I also love all of your imperfections that you used to be insecure about. I don’t know, I just really like it. I understand that you have skin issues, and I’m okay with that. It’s okay — we all have blemishes and little things we’re insecure about. Even with you being shorter than me — I don’t mind being taller than you. I hope you don’t mind me being taller because I kinda like wearing heels. I don’t want to make you feel more self-conscious about being with me.</p>

<h2>Positive Influence on My Life</h2>
<p>You’ve helped me make better decisions since being in college. I haven’t really been to any parties. I only drink. I don’t hang around bad company anymore. I stay in my room and enjoy our time, being there for myself, being there for you, being a support for others, and knowing that you support me too. When I have issues, I can go to you, even if it’s awkward, and you’re understanding. You wait until I’m actually ready to talk about everything entirely.</p>

<h2>Noticing the Little Things</h2>
<p>I just want you to know that I notice the little things that you do — the small shifts in energy, the little things you do to make us better. I like that you’re still you. You’re human, you still make mistakes, but you learn from them instead of using them as an excuse to act negatively.</p>

<h2>Closing Message</h2>
<p>And most importantly, I’m just really grateful for you, for us, and for everything we’re building together. <br>
Happy Valentine’s Day, Beast Boy. <br>
I love you ❤️</p>
